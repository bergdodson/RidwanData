Data for the Ridwan

The samples are divided based on spacing between MgO layers in the M2 layer.

The 1.1 Memristor Data folder memristors have 1:1 ratio between the MgO and Al2O3 layers in the M2 layer. In other words, there is only 1 Al2O3 layer between each MgO layer in the M2 layer

The 1.2 Memristor Data folder memristors have 1:2 ratio between the MgO and Al2O3 layers in the M2 layer. In other words, there are 2 Al2O3 layer between each MgO layer in the M2 layer
